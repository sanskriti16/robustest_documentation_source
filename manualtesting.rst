Now that you have created a project and selected a build to test, you may want to get right into it and perform some manual testing on your app.

To start a Manual test session:

1. Click on the 'Manual' icon on the Project Dashboard
   
   A device selection screen now pops up. You may search for a device on the 'Device selection screen' based on device name, platform version, screen size, hardware configuration (e.g. Memory and CPU),  node name, node IP, etc.
 
2. Select the device you wish to test on by clicking on the 'Select' button under the device

   *Note:* RobusTest provides you a way to select multiple devices in parallel to perform your manual testing. To know more go to the page on :ref:`multi-device-testing` 
  
3. Once you have selected the device, click on the 'Play' button on the top right corner
 
   The device screen now comes up and you can see that your app is installed on the device. 


Congratualtions! You have succesfully begun a Manual test session 

Now let's see how RobusTest helps you to test better 

The Manual Test Session, consists of 2 parts:

1. Device screen
2. Test Configuration section

**1. Device screen**

  The device screen is where you perform your testing. You can perform various gestures like tap, swipe, scroll and entering text with the help of mouse/trackpad and keyboard. The buttons at the bottom of the screen are available for use as Android navigation buttons.
 
**2. Test Configuration section**

  The 'Test Configuration' section enables you to test better and easier by providing various add-on features

  Thse features are available across 2 menus:

  a. Device Configuration menu or the Horizontal menu
  b. Vertical menu

  **a. Horizontal menu**

  This menu provides you options to perform various configurations related to the device. Let's have a look at each of them

  .. :bolditalic:`1. Location Simulation`

  **1. Location Simulation**

  This feature allows you to test as if the device is present at a different location than where it actually is. This is done by  simulating the location on the device.

  *Pre-requisites*:

    On the device:

      1. in Developer options:
         * enable 'Mock Locations'
         * set the Nizedha app as your mock location app
      2. in 'Locations', set the 'Location Mode' to 'Device only'


  Once the pre-requisites have been met, you can simulate any location as follows:

  1. Click on the 'Simulate Location' button
  2. Type the name of the location in the 'Search location here' field and select from the drop down. Alternatively, you can manually pin the location of your choice on the map
  3. Once your location has been pinned, click on the 'Set Location' button

    Your device will now behave as if it is situated at the location chosen by you

  .. :bolditalic:`2. Run ADB commands on device`

  **2. Run ADB commands on device**

   Sometimes, as part of your testing, you may want to run a few ADB commands on the device under testing. You can do so by clicking on the 'Run ADB commands on device' button.

   This brings up the Command Line Interfce from where you can execute adb commands directly on the device.

  .. :bolditalic:`3. Enable/Disable Navigation menu on device`

  **3. Enable/Disable Navigation menu on device**

   This button enables/disables the Android navigation menu bar at the botton of the device screen.

  .. :bolditalic:`4. Device screen size configuration`

  **4. Device screen size configuration**

   These buttons enable you to increase the screen size, decrease the screen size and to reset the device screen size to its default setting. This is useful in case you want to look at the app in more detail and want to verify the rendering of various objects on the screen.

  .. :bolditalic:`5. Device screen ratio configuration`

  **5. Device screen ratio configuration**

   These buttons enable you to increase or decrease the screen ratio. 

   This feature is helpful in scenarios, where the network bandwidth is low and the user would still like to test.

   Increasing the screen ratio decreases the resolution of the device screen and enables the user to continue testing at a lower bandwidth.

   Decreasing the screen ratio enables the user to test on the device screen at higher reslution.

  .. :bolditalic:`6. Device screen rotation`

  **6. Device screen rotation**

   You can test the device in Landscape and Portrait modes by rotating the device screen using these buttons

  **b. Vertical menu**

  This menu provides the user information that would aid in the testing process. Let's go through each of them.

  .. :bolditalic:`1. Session Information`

  **1. Session Information**

   Clicking on this button provides you all details regarding the manual test session in progress. This includes information about:-

   a. the build - App name, build version, last uploaded, etc
   b. the device - Device name, ADB ID, OS version, etc,
   c. the project - Project name, Last build uploaded, etc

  .. :bolditalic:`2. Focused View`

  **2. Focused View**

   Clicking on this button provides you a distraction-free view of the device screen so that you can focus solely on your testing 
   
  .. :bolditalic:`3. Create & View Contacts`

  **3. Create & View Contacts**

   The 'Contacts' feature is useful in use cases where you need to make calls or send SMSs to specific contacts or phone numbers.

   You can add names to the contact list and specify their contact numbers. Now you can call or send an SMS to these contacts from the device on which you are testing.

  .. :bolditalic:`4. Create & View Notes`

  **4. Create & View Notes**
   
   The 'Notes' feature enables you to save tidbits of information that may be of use to you at a later point in time or perhaps information which you may want to share with your project members. The notes you create are available to any project member even after the end of the test session in which the note was created.

  .. :bolditalic:`5. Execute Deeplink`

  **5. Execute Deeplink**

  This feature enables you to test deeplinks being used in your app. Provide the deeplink and, if required, the package name. Then click on 'Execute'. You can now see the deeplink being executed on the device

  **6. Copy from device clipboard**

  Sometimes the need arises where you may want to copy data from the device screen, say, - maybe a text in an app page or a URL opened on a browser on the device - to your own computer or laptop.

  In such cases, do the following:

     1. Copy the text you want to retrieve onto the device's clipboard by selecting and long pressing it
     2. Now click on the 'Copy from device clipboard' button in your Manual test session. This data is now available on the clipboard of your computer.
     3. Paste (Ctrl+V) the text anywhere on your computer
