App Monitoring
==============

Using RobusTest, you can create an App Monitor. An App Monitor continuously monitors a specific screen of your app for changes in the page elements. This is great for monitoring apps in production.

**App Monitor**

1. An App Monitor can be seen as a special case of a RobusTest Automator Test Case
2. An App Monitor test case will consist of three functions

a. Setup
b. Setup App State
c. Monitor


**Setup & Setup App State functions**

The Setup function & Setup App State function work together to bring the app to the state/screen which needs to be monitored. What is the difference between the two and the need for the two you may ask.

If while running the App Monitor, the app crashes or the app needs to be brough back to the screen because of screen stuck, then the system will use the test steps in the SetApp State to come back to the screen.

If while running the App Monitor, the monitoring process as a whole crashes or errors out, then the system will need to start the whole process from the start including logging into the app or similar steps which will be required for a fresh install. In such a case the Setup and Setup App State functions will both be run in that order.

**Monitor function**

The Monitor function contains the steps which specify which elements on the screen need to be monitored.
To create a monitor step, click on the Monitor button on the upper toolbar in the Automator session
Provide values for the various fields in the pop up dialog

 * Event Name - Provide a name for the event

 * Event Description - Provide a description for the event

 * Event XPath - Provide the XPath for the element that you wish 

 * Restart Monitor Timeout

 * Detect Event

Create an app monitor by creating a test case with the following steps in the same order

Step 1: Import Setup function
Step 2: Import Setup App State function
Step 3: Import Monitor function

When saving this test case, select the test case type as Monitoring.
Add this test case to a test suite
