This is the vertical menu that you see in the Manual test session. It provides the user information that would aid in the testing process. Let's go through each of them.

   **1. Session Information**

   Clicking on this button provides you all details regarding the manual test session in progress. This includes information about:-

   a. the build - App name, build version, last uploaded, etc
   b. the device - Device name, ADB ID, OS version, etc,
   c. the project - Project name, Last build uploaded, etc

   **2. Focused View**

   Clicking on this button provides you a distraction-free view of the device screen so that you can focus solely on your testing 
   
   **3. Create & View Contacts**

   The 'Contacts' feature is useful in use cases where you need to make calls or send SMSs to specific contacts or phone numbers.

   You can add names to the contact list and specify their contact numbers. Now you can call or send an SMS to these contacts from the device on which you are testing.

   **4. Create & View Notes**
   
   The 'Notes' feature enables you to save tidbits of information that may be of use to you at a later point in time or perhaps information which you may want to share with your project members. The notes you create are available to any project member even after the end of the test session in which the note was created.

   **5. Execute Deeplink**

   This feature enables you to test deeplinks being used in your app. Provide the deeplink and, if required, the package name. Then click on 'Execute'. You can now see the deeplink being executed on the device 

   **6. Copy from device clipboard**

   Sometimes the need arises where you may want to copy data from the device screen, say, - maybe a text in an app page or a URL opened on a browser on the device - to your own computer or laptop.

   In such cases, do the following:

     1. Copy the text you want to retrieve onto the device's clipboard by selecting and long pressing it
     2. Now click on the 'Copy from device clipboard' button in your Manual test session. This data is now available on the clipboard of your computer.
     3. Paste (Ctrl+V) the text anywhere on your computer 

   **7. Device Screenshot**

   This feature enables you to take capture the device screen at any point during testing. You can use this to highlight an issue and share it with your colleagues

   **8. Burst Mode Screenshot**  

    Burst Mode is an advanced mode of taking screenshots. On clicking on this button, for a period of 30 seconds, a screenshot is automatically taken everytime there is a change on the devcice screen. At the end of this period, you can individually edit and download each screenshot.

    This feature proves very helpful in cases where you would like to capture an entire flow in your testing scenario.

   **9. Device Log**

   You can view the logcat report in a tabular format with options to filter by the log level. You also have the option to download the log in CSV format.

   **10. ANR Log**

   The ANR log or the 'Application Not Responding' report is generated in the event that your app crashes. This log gives you significant information in determining the casue of the crash and is also available for download.

   **11. Share Test Session**

   If you encounter a situation where you find a specific scenario in your app flows that you would like to cross-check with or show to your colleagues but they aren't nearby, don't worry, we got your back.

   The 'Share Test Session' feature enables you to collaborate with colleagues by sharing your device screen with them.

   You can share your device screen in two ways:-

   a. by sending them a link to your device link by clicking on the 'Copy Share-Link to Clipboard' button

   b. by scanning the QR code displayed with a mobile phone

   Once your colleagues click on the link you shared or finish scanning the QR code, not only can they see you perform various actions on the device screen, they can also interact with the same device screen through their computer or mobile device. 

   **12. Connecting to ADB remotely**

   This feature was developed with the intention to help your dev team.

   Let's say you find an issue while testing and then reach out to a developer for support. 

   Now, if this developer would like to access the ADB on the same device for further investigation, she or he can do so remotely by running the command displayed on your screen.

   They can now work on the device as if it is connected directly to their own computer.

   This feature is also of use to developers who may want to test their code while developing on Android Studio

   **13. Switch to multiplexing**

   You can toggle between multi-device testing and testing in a single device using this button.

   **14. Log bug**    

   Use this feature to directly logs bugs that you encounter while testing into your bug tracking system, without moving away from your test session.

   RobusTest supports API integration with a host of third-party bug tracking software such as JIRA, Bugzilla, etc.

   Once integration with the bug tracking software is enabled from the Admin Console, you can start logging bugs.

   While logging the bug, you can choose the Assignee, the reporter, the type of issue, a summary of the issue and a detailed description. You also have the option to attach the device logs, the ANR log and screenshots as well.

   At the time of logging of the bug, in addition to the above details, RobusTest will add more information to the ticket pertaining to the app, app version, OS version, device details, project details, etc

   **15. Change Wifi**    

   Sometimes you may want your test device to connect to a different Wifi network. In such cases, you can use this feature to select the Wifi network of your choice by providing the SSID and Password.

   **16. Install Build**

   This option enables you to select and install a build of your choice from the options provided in the drop down. Only builds previously uploaded to your project will be available for selection    

   **17. Network Shaping**

   Network Shaping enables you to select a specific kind of network to test your app on. E.g. 2G, 3G, 4G, etc. You are enabled to create an ATC Network profile which simulates charcteristics of the kind of network you choose. You can know more about creating ATC profiles in the Admin Console section.
