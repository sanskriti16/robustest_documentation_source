Setting Up RobusTest for HTTPs access
=====================================

By default RobusTest is accessible using HTTP. However, it is very easy to configure RobusTest for HTTPs access. The only information required from the user are the following for the FQDN on which RobusTest is accessed e.g. If you access your device lab on devicelab.acme.com, then you need to provide 

1. Certificate file
2. Private Key file

This needs to be provided to the RobusTest team to setup HTTPs based access.
