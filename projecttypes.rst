Types of Projects
=================

RobusTest enables you to create 4 types of projects depending on your testing requirements:

1. Android App Project
2. iOS App Project
3. Mobile WebApp Project
4. Device Only Project

Let's have a brief look at each of them:


**1. Android App Project**

Select this option when your goal is to test an Android app. Once the project has been created, you can upload your *.apk file or app build to the project and begin testing on the same.

**2. iOS App Project**

Select this option when your goal is to test an iOS app. Once the project has been created, you can upload your *.ipa file or app build to the project. Once oyour iOS devices are set up you can begin testing on the uploaded build.

**3. Mobile WebApp Project**

Select this option if your intention is to test a Mobile WebApp. On doing so, you will now be prompted to enter the URL to be tested. Enter the URL for the WebApp and create the project.

In a mobile WebApp project, in order to test, you need to do the following:

1. Select a device for testing
2. Select a browser on which you would like to open the WebApp
   - you will be provided a list of browsers to choose from. These are browsers that are available on the selected device
3. Once your selections are completed, the Mobile WebApp will be launched on the browsr you selected on the device. You may now commence with your testing.

**4. Device Only Project**

This type of project is helpful when your goal is not to test an app but to test SIM related use cases. E.g. Making phone calls, sending SMSs, checking associated rate changes, etc.
