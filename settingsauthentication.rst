Authentication Settings
=======================

A new user account can be created in RobusTest in 2 ways:
1. The RobusTest Admin creates the user account and activates it
2. The new user clicks on the 'Create Account', enters the information asked for (such as name, email ID, etc.), creates the account and the waits for the RobusTest Admin to activate the account


When a new user account is created on RobusTest, it is essential that she/he be authenticated.


RobusTest provides you a number of ways to authenticate a new or existing user on RobusTest

**1. Enable email signup**

* Enabling this option, allows a new user to register or sign up on RobusTest from the Login page by clicking on the 'Create Account' button.
* If this checkbox is not enabled, then the 'Create Account' button will not be visible on the RobusTest Login page. In such scenarios, the RobusTest Admin alone has the privilege to create an account on behalf of a new user.

**2. Require email confirmation by user**

* If this checkbox is not enabled, then, on signing up for a new account on RobusTest, the new user has to wait for the RobusTest Admin to enable the account 
* If this checkbox is enabled, then, on signing up for a new account, the user receives an email in her/his inbox (i.e., the email id that was mentioned while creating the account). The user then clicks on the confirmation link in the email to authenticate their self.

**3. Require user activation by administrator**

* If this checkbox is enabled, then it is mandatory for the RobusTest Admin to activate a new user on the p[latform.
* If this checkbox is disabled, then the new user is automatically activated after the account is created.

**4. Domains**

* This option enables you to restrict registration of new users on RobusTest to specific domains.
* You can provide a list of domain names in a comma separated format
* E.g. robustes.com,gmail.com

**5. Google Sign Up**

* Enabling this option lets you sign in with your Google client credentials
* For this you also need to provide your Google Client ID and Google client secret
